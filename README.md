Task4:
-> Sentiment Analysis with NLP

->Task Objective
In this task, I built a sentiment analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python.
The goal was to classify tweets as positive or negative.

->Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK

->Dataset
I used a Twitter dataset that contains text and sentiment labels (0 = Negative, 1 = Positive). The data was taken from a public source.

->Steps I Followed
- Loaded the dataset
- Cleaned the tweets by removing links, punctuation, and stopwords
- Converted the text to numbers using TF-IDF
- Trained a Logistic Regression model to predict sentiment
- Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification report

->Key Insights
- The model gave good accuracy on test data
- TF-IDF helped convert text into meaningful features
- Logistic Regression was simple and effective for classification

Output:
The notebook contains all steps, results, and accuracy scores.
